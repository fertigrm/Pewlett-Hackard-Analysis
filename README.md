# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview of project
## This project was done for Pewlett-Hackard with the intention of finding employees who where going to be eligible for retirement, with the goal of knowing how many positions they will need to be filling, positions to replace, and to scout out potential Employees for mentorship programs. This analysis was done using SQL, PostGres, and PGAdmin to take advantage of the power of tables, queries, much more.
